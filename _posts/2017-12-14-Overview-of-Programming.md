Seriously, I am not a die-hard programmer but I code for making my Algorithms works and I like it. In this era of digitalisation, learning programming is one of the priliminary one which helps one to absorb and understand the dynamically evolving world. Different people have different people reason for their interest in programming. In world of programming, there are several different programming languages and each have their own advantages and disadvantages. The typical 256 programming languages are mentioned in this [Dzone Page](https://dzone.com/articles/big-list-256-programming).

If you are interested in getting placed in some cool cooperates like Google, Facebook, Microsoft,.etc.. Then you must select one of the cool programming Language and practise it. People there in those cooperate doesn't actually much care about what programming language you know but they make sure you are good with the following things (May be added with some):
<ul>
<li> Problem Solving Ability </li>
<li> Algorithm & Data Structures </li>
<li> Experience on Programming </li>
</ul>
As these points hadn't scored any programming languages, that doesn't mean you can select any programming language randomly and practise. Selecting a good programming language for your application is a critical one it indirectly places a major part in getting though some tough interviews. Just look at the pre-defined points for getting into some cool coperates, "Problem solving ability" totally independent on the type of programming languages, Whatever language you choose, its your mental training and focus that actual makes you good in this criteria. But remaining two mainly depends on the language you choose, you may read some 400 or 600 pages books on "Algorithm & Data Strutures" or separate books on each topics but what actually makes you good in this topics is directly applying it and that actually means you need a programming language that facilitates you in doing so and most particularly you should be comfortable with that language. Following that, to shine in "Experience on work" criteria who should really live a typical programmers life for atleast 6 months and several startups concerns will help you a lot in gathering more Experience on the field, in this context and as a founder of my own startup, I need to add that I am preparing a separate blog on "Learning from Startups". And also don't think getting into a startup is a easy task, you can't join as a trainee in any startup and they don't have both time and funds for supporting your learning. People in startups ask for coders having proficiency in a particularly language and yeah if you choose some poor language with less amount of application you can't get any works even as a free lanchers and you can't get a startup needing programmers in that language.

So, If you want me to Recommend some best programming languages, Here are some of the languages I suggest. you can learn any one of this.

1. Javascript
2. Python
3. Java
4. Swift
5. Ruby

I am going to describe more on each languages. Let me start from last, [RUBY]() is a simple and good but been popular maily because of its framework named [Ruby on Rails]() which is one of the best and cool framework for web development with lot of community support, if you have passion of becoming a good web developer(backend) probably this language is for you. Then comes SWIFT, favourite language for apple. This language is used create apps for both iphones and ipads. Swift developers are very rare and wanted by numerous startups and even by MNCs. There are good tutorials, documentations and communities available online which you can use in learning this, but don't you need a Macbook for working on this language. Next, JAVA is one of the oldest and most accepted languages. There are several application of Java including Android. Even though there are more Java developers, still companies these expert in this in high demand. Here comes my favourite, PYTHON is one of the coolest and most used languages in world. Several Companies including python have most of their application written in python. When your are focused on Algorithms, Analytics, Science,..then Python is for you. Most of the programs in Machine Learning, Data Analytics are written Python. Python can also adapted for web development with the advent of two awesome framework name Django and Flask. Learning Python is made Simple with several Tutorials, documentations, Communities Supports,.etc.. There will be always oppurtunity for python developers in several areas. Atlast, JAVASCRIPT derived from Java is a awesome language from front-end Designers. It mostly run in client side making it more robust and reliable. Whatever website you crawl, Javascript plays a major part in that. Nowdays, Javascript is also being used for backend programming in the name of NodeJS.

Most people start their programming journey from [C Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), then followed with [C++](). C++ will help us in understanding the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming concept shortly known as OOPS. OOPS refined the possibilities of programming. Having OOPS as base several programming languages came into existence like JAVA, PYTHON, RUBY, GO,..etc. Each one has its own use cases and functionalities. As I told before that I am not a Die-Hard programmer and I have knowledge on programming in some limited domains, I can't be more generic on this. My works are mostly in Python, Ruby, C++,..etc. Let me first project the domains I am familiar with and the programming concepts that will be covered in this post will be mostly from these domains.
<ul>
<li> Web-Development </li>
<li> Data Analysis </li>
<li> Machine Learning </li>
<li> Shell scripting </li>
<li> Deep Learning </li>
</ul>

Let me start with Web-Development, world of web had seen many drastic changes in the last 5 year and is being updated dynamically in a daily. With the advent of open-source contribution, Different libraries and tools are been developed and maintained by several open source contributor.
