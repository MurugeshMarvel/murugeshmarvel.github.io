Its easy to guess from the name **Machine Learning**, which implies some process related to learning process of machines. And Nowdays people are really curious to learn Machine learning by witnessing the changes that it bought. This blog is not for some programming geeks or for people with computer science background. I will try my best to explain this concept as low as possible. 
> Machine learning is field in Artificial Intelligence which allow machines to learn from the experience(data) rather than being hard-coded.

**What is Learning ?**

The most easy way to grap the learning concept without stepping to the cognitive science is by considering some real-time example. Consider a Scenario, you got a new job and you are leaving for the new-office from your house for the first time. Possibly, you wil
**But are they are not learning before this ML concept?** - Not really!. before the time, all the systems are explicity programmed with rules and there is no possible ways for the system to learn.
**Do Machines Really have to Learn?** - If you want your machine to assist you in a better possible way than the rules based thing, you have to let your machine to learn, letting it to know your data for optimising its assistance.
